I have four or x elements and I want to add another 1 to the list

if there is no space

then exit

else
	
	if the position does not exist

	then exit

	else

		 while i < position_required

			do if i = num_of_elements - 1

				do A[i++] = A[i];

				i--


binSearch(num_searched,low,high)
{
	if this is the number I am looking

		return 

	else 

	mid = (high+low)/2 

	if the number i am looking for greater then the number i am on

	Binsearched(num_searched, mid, high)

	else

	binSearched(num_searched,low,mid)
}

for i = 0

popping

if
