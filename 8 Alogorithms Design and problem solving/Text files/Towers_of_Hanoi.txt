beginging - three pieces

begin stick has three sizes

middle stick has none, as well as end

move small to end --- move 0 to tower 3

move mode to middle --- move 1 to tower 2

move small to middle --- move 0 to tower 2

move large to end --- move 2 to tower 3

move small to begin --- move o to tower 1

move mode to end --- move 1 to tower

move small to end --- move 0 to tower 3

end 


small = 0;

medium = 1;

large = 2

begin = middle = end = large

i = random(1,3)
