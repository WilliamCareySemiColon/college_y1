sin (x)                     x = type double
cos (x)
tan (x)

pow(x,y) = Z                x to the power of y    X y Z are double types

log(x)                      x is a double type

rand();   -> int  ->   DO NOT USE   -> Use Srand(x)    x = seed value, which is the value you have inputted for the range   x is an integer



strings

this is a array of characters

eg char word [10];

char word [] = {'H' 'E' 'L' 'L' 'O' '\0'};

eg printf("Hello") -> string literal

eg "Hello world",he said

printf("\"Hello world\", he said");

"The C:\ is the root drive",he said

printf("\"The C:\\ is the root drive \", he said");


printf("This is a very long string that goes on and on forever.......");

                   |
                   down


printf("this is a very\
		long string that go\
		es on and on forever\                       No code inside or comments in this area
		....";)


printf("This is a very long"
		"string that goes"
		"on and on forever....";)
