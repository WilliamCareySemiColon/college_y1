a) since there is a space between the two assignments, the complier won't know which to do, as one is calling to do a comparison function, while the other is doing an assignment operation. Because of this, the if statement will never get executed.

b) int arr[12]

for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++)
{
	arr [i] = i + 1;
}

c) #define SIZE 12

d) to have access to the contents of a variable by storing its address

e) puts() displays a literal string or the contents of a character array while gets() takes a string of character and stores it inside a array, even if there is a space within the string  

eg puts("\"What is your name(s)?\"");
   gets(name);

   puts(name);

f) a programmer complier checks all the lines of the code before converting it into an excutable, where as an interpreter checks line by line as it converts it

g) 7 4 7 3

h) printf("\"The home drive is on the u:\drive\", he said.");

i) The input in going out of bounds
   the complier won't know what is the inout due to no delimeter
   The first place in the array is completely ignored

j) the purpose of the typedef function is to change a keyword or variable into any word you want from th point and place you declare it onwards

eg typedef int * INT_POINTER
