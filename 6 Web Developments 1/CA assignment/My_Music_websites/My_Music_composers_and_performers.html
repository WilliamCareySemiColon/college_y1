					<h2><strong>The Cheiftans</strong></h2>
						<p>
							In the early 1950s, Irish music wasnt even popular in Ireland. Dublin found it quite odd, and the younger generation were learning the international popular music. However, Maloney was leanrning Irish Music, and he was going in the middle of the revival period. As ambassadors for traditional Irish music, the Chieftains are without peer stated Rick Mason in the Pioneer Press. And although their rabid following is still considered cultish it is devoted and widespread. Folk music isn't supposed to be this popular.<br><br>

							 The quality is enhanced by the individual talents of its members. According to Stephen Holden of the New York Times,<strong> Paddy Moloney</strong> is the master of the uilleann pipes. Moloney is also an accomplished composer and the Chieftain's primary producer. Both harpist <strong> Derek Bell</strong> and<strong> fiddler Martin</strong> Fay are classically trained, and<strong> Sean Keane was an all-Ireland fiddle champion</strong>. All of the members of the band share in the musical arrangements. In Rolling Stone, Scott Isler noted that it is the bands credentials as well as their arrangements that distinguish the Chieftains from other tradition-bound Irish groups.

				<h2><strong>The Dubliners</strong>
				</h2>
				<p>
					The original members of the band who congregated at O'Donoghue's were<strong> Ronnie Drew, Luke Kelly, Ciaran Bourke</strong> and<strong> Barney McKenna</strong> . John Sheahan joined in 1964.When they first started performing together they were known as<strong> Ronnie Drew Ballad Group</strong>. Drew was never really happy with the name though as he felt it much too much emphasis on him at the expense of the others. The problem of finding a more acceptable name was solved when Luke Kelly started reading the novel, <strong>The Dubliners</strong>, by James Joyce. As they were all Dublin musicians, the new name suited them perfectly.<br><br>

					The Dubliners quickly established themselves in Ireland and soon went on to become major stars across the world. Music writer Eric Winter describes how they took the English folk music world by storm after appearing on the BBC television show Hootenanny. In his introduction to the Dubliners Songbook, Winter wrote: "Some liked them for their rough diamond quality. Some liked them for their irreverence. They didn't mind knocking anything that was going, including many of the most cherished ideas about themselves held by the Irish".
