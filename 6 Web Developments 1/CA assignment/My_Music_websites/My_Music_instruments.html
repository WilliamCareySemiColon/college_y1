 				<h3>Bodhran:</h3>

				<p>
					The <strong>Bodhran</strong> is a percussion Irish instrument. Also known as the heartbeat, the Bodhran typically is played in a particular rhythm to keep
					the strongbeat of the song going. It is an instrument that has goat skin stretched across one side and has the other side hallow. It is pronounced <strong>"bow-rawn"</strong> and is played with an stick object known as <strong>Cipen, Tripper</strong> or <strong>Beater</strong> or using the hand. Some of the famous performers who have played are <strong>Christy Moore, Caroline</strong> and <strong>Junior Davey</strong>. Despite being only the rhythm, in modern society the background is just as important as all the others factors, like harmony, meaning the bodhran still has a long life.

				<h3>Piano Accordion:</h3>

				<p>

It is a melsdon instrument, where it had a single row of buttons to play. It is a a woodwind instrument, as the instrument has a reed inside it. Because it has buttons, it can play both harmonies and melodies, also can be an accompanient to any other instrument. This flexible instrument is a popular instrument in folk music. <strong>Dermot O'Brien</strong> is a performer who can play this instrument.

				<h3>Uillean Pipes</h3>

				<p>
					The direct translation of <strong>Uillean</strong> is <strong>uille</strong> meaning <strong>Elbow</strong>. By eighteenth century these instruments were replacing the harp as the most popular instrument for entertainment. The instrument consist of bellows, bags, chanter, drones and regulations. The chanter is the double reed part, where the air goes in to feed the musical part of the piper. The chanter also consist of seven holes in the front part and one in the part, which is common to a lot of woodwind instruments. Piping started to dye as a result of the great famine. So pipiing competitions kept it alive to the modern. There are three versions of the drone - bass, tenor and baritone. to name a few performers, such as Liam O'Flynn, Paddy Maloney and Paddy Keenan.

				<h3> Bones and Spoons</h3>

				<p>
					Bones have be used to create a quick rhythm that other instruments cannot reach. They are only used for rhythm purposes, but they can created an syncopated rhythm on top of another percussion, such as Bonhran. Since they are quite simple in comparison to other instruments, they are among the first one we pick up and dispatch quickly. Spoons are performed in the same way, which would be surprizing to some people. One performer of this instrument is Mel Mercier.

					<h3>Harp</h3>

					<p>
						The Harp has always been part of the Irish tradition for as long has the Irish has been able to record, write and of course speak. They all have a triangular style to them, and have been around since the 8th century. The oldest harp that still exist is in trinty college and is called the <strong>Brin Born</strong> Harp. It has existed since the fifteenth century. This harp woulb be played with fingernails, has 29 steel strings and gives a bell like sound as it rings. This playing style would have completely dide out if the <strong>Belfast Harp Festival</strong> did not gather harpers to compete. Only one harper arrived that played in the old fashioned style. The music was recorded at the festival, which perserved the music. The new harp, also known as the <strong>Neo Harp</strong> is smaller, has nylon strings, more strings and is played with fingertips.
