LINKED LISTS

This links different variables together without a naming convention most of the time

eg 

//struct template
struct list
{
	char list1 [11];
	char list2 [11];

	//this points at another struct with the same contents as "struct list"
	struct list *next;
};


int main()
{
	//the three variables follows the above struct template
	struct list sample3 = {
							//list1
							"abc";

							//list2
							"123";

							//what next is pointing to
							Null;
	};

	struct list sample2 = {
							//list1
							"abc";

							//list2
							"123";

							//what next is pointing to
							&sample3;
	};

	struct list sample1 = {
							//list1
							"abc";

							//list2
							"123";

							//what next is pointing to
							&sample2;
	};

	`//this is the head of the linked lists this ppints to the begining of the list
	struct list head, *current;

	current = head.next = &sample1;

	//to access each content of the list
	while (current->next != NULL)
	{
		current = current->next;
	}
}end main
